# Ayika Foundation
## The Ecological Revolution

Ayika Foundation is a youth led NGO that works toward mitigating climate change and making the world a better place. We are currently accepting funds for our Delhi chapter. More info at @ayika.foundation on Instagram.

### Who We Are
We are a group of young activists who wish to create a difference in the society by doing all that we can. Climate action and animal welfare are two issues that are matter to us the most, and therefore, we work to create awareness about climate action through our events. Our mission aims at making the Earth green for the next generations to thrive on and to provide animals a safer home and proper care.

### What We Do
Ayika Foundation works towards creating a sustainable future for humans and animals alike by conducting various projects, drives, campaigns, spreading awareness, writing blogs, and hosting podcasts. We wish to transform the way people think about waste management, and promote animal protection. We recently conducted a public park cleanup and recycling campaign.
